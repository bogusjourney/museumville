Some people love working with cultural heritage. Everyone loves to play. 
What if we turned work into play?

- Build your own museum
- Hunt for treasures
- Show others
- Keep your exhibitions in order

As a Museum Curator, your role is to collect Europeana artifacts (Items) and
create Exhibitions with them.

# Scoring Points #

The purpose of playing is to create more and more valuable exhibits.


## Popularity ##

Points are gained on unique visits.

Generated Europeana value:

  - stats on popular items and viable/interesting groupings of items


## Origin Popularity ##

Points are gained when visitors leave the exhibit by clicking on a link to the homepage of the item.

(Technical solution: exit page or "pingback" from homepage (probably unfeasible).)

Generated Europeana value:

  - stats on popularity of an item


## Categorizing Records ##

Points are gained when curators 

Categories: places, periods, persons, subjects/themes/tropes...

Generated Europeana value:

  - continuously curated item categorizations (under the hood: linked data in the form of dct:subjects for Items, and categories as Concepts expressed in SKOS.)
